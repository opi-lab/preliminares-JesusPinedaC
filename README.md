# Basic Image Handling and Processing

**Jesus Pineda Castro**

This repo is a dumping ground for notes taken during my *Computer Vision* course. The examples we will develop are based on Jan Erik Solem's book titled **Programming Computer Vision with Python_ Tools and algorithms for analyzing images**. Definitely a really good introduction to image processing !!

In this repo you will find Jupyter Notebooks for the course. For quicker view rendering and simpler downloading procedures, you can check out this repo using [NbViewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org).

# Contents

1. **ch01-ex1.ipynb**: In this example we take an image, apply Gaussian blur and plot the image contours for increasing values of sigma.
2. **ch01-ex2.ipynb**: We Implement an unsharp masking operation by blurring an image and then subtracting the blurred version from the original. This gives a sharpening effect to the image. In this tutorial we try this on both color and grayscale images.
3. **ch01_example1.ipynb**: The singular value decomposition (SVD) has many useful applications especially in the field of digital image compression. This tutorial illustrates the SVD image compression process.
4. **ch01_example2.ipynb**: The Python Imaging Library (PIL) provides general image handling and lots of useful basic image operations like resizing, cropping, rotating, color conversion and much more. This example introduces the basic tools for working with images.
