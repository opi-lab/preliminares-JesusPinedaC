# Basic Image Handling and Processing

**Jesus Pineda Castro**

This repo is a dumping ground for notes taken during my *Computer Vision* course. The examples we will develop are based on Jan Erik Solem's book titled **Programming Computer Vision with Python_ Tools and algorithms for analyzing images**. Definitely a really good introduction to image processing !!

In this repo you will find Jupyter Notebooks for the course. For quicker view rendering and simpler downloading procedures, you can check out this repo using [NbViewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org).
